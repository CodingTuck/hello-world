# hello-world
Getting my feet wet with github!


Hey all!

I'm an aspiring developer who is currently in school 
for computer programming. My graduation date is in December
But I might go super hard and finish in the Summer!

I have a beautiful wife and 2 amazing kids and my career
Change is for myself and to better support them! I'm currently
In Finance but the goal is to get an entry level programming job
By the summer! I love to learn and figure things out and keep
My mind busy and the feeling and sense of accomplishment that 
Coding gives me is pure satisfaction!
